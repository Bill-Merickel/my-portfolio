xv6 is a simple Unix-like teaching operating system taught in Georgia Tech's Operating System Design course. I have added multiple enhancements to the OS, including debugging functionality through a stack backtrace implementation, support for variable memory sizes, improved virtual allocation through copy-on-write forking and lazy zero-page allocation, various program scheduling algorithms, kernel threading, user authentication, and file permissions settings.
