TileVania is a 2D platformer similar to classic retro games. You are stuck in a dungeon with several levels to overcome, each increasing in difficulty. Traverse the levels and collect as many coins as you can to maximize your score without hitting the enemies. Play it [here](https://play.unity.com/mg/other/webglbuild-772)!
