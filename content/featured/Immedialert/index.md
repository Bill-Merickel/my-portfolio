Immedialert is an iOS and Android App that streamlines the process of emergency communication within school campuses. Main Stream is an organization wide messaging platform containing all members that is used for urgent messages across the school. Chats allow faculty members to create group chats of their choosing. The app supports push notifications so every user can stay current with administrator announcements and live communications in the event of an emergency.
